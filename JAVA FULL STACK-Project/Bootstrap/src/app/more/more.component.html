<p style="color: cyan;">  * Our MAAN INFOTECH CFO Decision-Making Survey, August 2022, uncovered insights into a decision-making dilemma CFOs face today.</p><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">  * 93% of CFOs we surveyed agree that the responsibilities they have been entrusted with feel much greater than in the past.</p><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">  * 86% of CFOs say the speed of their strategic decision-making has increased.</p><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">  * 67% of CFOs say they feel paralyzed at times by the number of decisions and volume of choices they are expected to make.</p><br><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">===>Today, leading organizations are looking at new ways to reinvent the enterprise. The goal is to fuel growth and optimize operations. And they’re turning to CFOs to drive their sweeping reinventions. But as the speed of business increases, so does complexity. Understanding what’s needed to accelerate interconnected transformations is key. It’s how CFOs can drive successful enterprise reinvention. It’s also a critical skillset for the modern CFO.</p><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">===>To help CFOs overcome the challenges they face today, MAAN INFOTECH has developed two complementary points of views. They explore how CFOs can maximize the effectiveness of their strategic decision-making in today’s fast-paced and complex business environment.</p><br>
<p style="color: cyan;">===>The first paper is titled The Paradox of Choice for CFOs – A guide for enterprise reinvention in the age of complexity. It presents insights on how CFOs can overcome the paradox of choice. In it, we discuss how to accelerate strategic decision-making. The upcoming second paper, the CFO Success Paradigm, will expand upon the findings of the first point of view, offering a novel approach to help CFOs navigate the complex dynamics of decision-making and the impact they drive. It helps CFOs successfully execute better decisions at the right time.</p><br>
